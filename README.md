# Burger Meister
A Tracking Application for the Burger Devotee

## Individual Project 12 (Burger) 

The assignment was to implement Node JS, Express JS, MySQL, and Handlebars to create and burger tracking application employing servers to run the app as a website. This is a single page style site wherein the user can add burgers they would like to eat to a list which appears to the left of the add burger text entry area. If the user has eaten a given burger, they can click on the name of the burger and it is transfered to the burgers eaten area on the right side of the burger text entry area. The project follows a Model-View-Controller design pattern and utilizes Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
